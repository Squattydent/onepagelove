		<p><b>Hearts</b> - Now that you are logged in you will notice little grey hearts next to the site titles. It's grey because it has no love. This not only applies to One Page websites but also to templates, blog posts, interviews and resources you might want to save for reference.</p>

		<p><b>Saving</b> - When you click the heart it will turn pink as it is filled with love. The site will now be saved to your favorites ie. this page. Simply click the heart again to unsave and the post will return to it's original lonely grey state.</p>
